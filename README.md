Overview
This repository contains some of my projects from the Neural Networks and Deep Learning course I took during my Master's program at the University of Tehran. The course provided an in-depth understanding of the architecture of deep neural networks and the algorithms developed to extract high-level feature representations from data.

Course Content
Theoretical Foundations
Backpropagation: Learning algorithm for training neural networks.
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD): Optimization algorithm used for minimizing the cost function.
Practical Implementations
We gained hands-on experience building deep neural network models using Python and popular machine learning libraries, such as TensorFlow and Keras. Below are the types of neural networks we explored:

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): Used primarily for image recognition and classification tasks.
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN): Suitable for sequential data and time-series analysis.
Self-Organizing Maps (SOM): Unsupervised learning technique for clustering and visualization of high-dimensional data.
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): A type of RNN effective for learning long-term dependencies.
